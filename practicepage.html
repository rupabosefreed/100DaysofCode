        <h1> This page is to practice what I'm learning in TOP</h1>
        <h2>The above is header 1, this is header 2</h2>
        <h6>There are six headers possible; this is the sixth</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Let's make an unordered list. This is point 1</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>And now an ordered list! This is point #1</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is just normal text. If we want to make it bold we can use the strong tag like so: <strong>bold words</strong>. 
        We can also make text italicized to emphasize it with the em tag: <em>emphasis</em></p>

        <p>If we want a new paragraph, separated from the previous, we need to make a p (paragraph) tag and put the new content in that.</p>
